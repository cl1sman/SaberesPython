This is a set of twenty tutorials which will introduce you to Python- the basics, the applications, the built in data 
structures, basic text processing, data science tasks, and the principles of Object Oriented Programming. These 
tutorials will assume that you do know a little bit of programming in some language. You will learn with the help 
of simple and well documented programs and code snippets. (NOTE: Some of these tutorials have yet to be completed)
